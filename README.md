# Teams IXC Booking Bot
A bot that helps in the booking process for Cisco's IXC @ Dubai.
Submission for the Cisco EMEA

   - What is the story?  What was the business challenge?
  + The booking process is e-mail intensive. (http://ixc.cisco.com/ixc/)
  + After the customer enters the booking details, he needs to wait for another mail just to send him a briefing link. 
  + The IXC admins need to check (manually) the existence of the Deal ID filled in by the customer.

   - Goal of the Software Project
  + New booking experience is needed, Design thinking workshop outcome : Create a webex teams bot to streamline the booking       process.
  + User should be referred to the briefing form to fill after creating a reservation.
  

Libraries used in this project :

  - webexteamsbot : https://pypi.org/project/webexteamsbot/
  - Some Python standard libraries (requests, os, configparser)
  

  
  
# How do I run this bot on my machine ?
  
  - Download the IXC Booking Bot.py from this repo
  
  - Install the previously referenced library in your folder (webexteamsbot)
  
  - Create another .py file for your environment variables (Booked API session token, Cisco Teams API token...), you can name 
    it environmentVariables.py if you don't want to make any changes on the main Bot code.
    Check Annex 2 if you don't know how to set your environment variables.
    
  - In case you're not deploying the bot online and want to test it on your localhost, you need to make your localhost
    available to the internet (i.e exposing your bot to the internet). I used ngrok as a tunneling technology.
    Obviously you can use your own choice (localTunnel or serveo are good alternatives).
    Here is a Cisco Devnet tutorial on how to use ngrok : 
    https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/collab-spark-botl-ngrok/step/1
    
  - That's it ! Now go and run your Bot/Flask server and test the bot :)
